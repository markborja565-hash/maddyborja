    <h1 style="color: white;">HELLO! HOW ARE YOU?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">My name is Maddy Borja. I am 20 years old and I live in Barangay 602, Santa Mesa, Manila. I was born in Manajo, a town in the province of Northern Samar. About myself, I am a member of the rainbow community, also known as the LGBT Community, and I am proud to be a transgender individual and part of this community. I wrote this autobiography to share my life story who I am, how I have become the person I am today, and my aspirations for the future. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire anyone who reads it.

I have five siblings two brothers and three sisters. My mother is a single parent, but she is now in a new relationship. One of my sisters is a college student and is currently in her second year. My two other sisters are already working. One of my brothers got married at a young age and now has one child. Another one of my siblings is the one supporting me in college.

As a student, I have slowly come to realize the value of education and how important it is to have a good foundation in life. It’s about how proud you are of yourself as someone who believes in your own success and abilities. I hold on to the belief that we create our own future and dreams. So, always stay positive in life and believe in your own journey.</p>
